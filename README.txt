 Challenges and Solutions

- Challenge: Maintaining dark/light mode across all pages  
  Solution: Used `localStorage` and a theme toggle function applied on page load

- Challenge: Validating multiple types of inputs in the survey form  
  Solution: Wrote a custom JavaScript function checking all required fields and showing alerts

- Challenge: Ensuring consistent responsiveness across all pages  
  Solution: Used media queries with CSS Flexbox and Grid to handle different screen sizes

- Challenge: Keeping the site accessible and semantically correct  
  Solution: Applied semantic tags (`<section>`, `<main>`, `<nav>`, `<figure>`), added `alt` attributes to all images, and validated with W3C tools
